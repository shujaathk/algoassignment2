we can assume that the rook is initially
located in the lower left corner of a chessboard, whose rows and columns
are numbered from 1 to 8. 

Let P(i, j) be the number of the rook’s
shortest paths from square (1,1) to square (i, j) in the ith row and the jth
column, where 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 8. 

Any such path will be composed of vertical
and horizontal moves directed toward the goal. 

Obviously, P(i, 1) =P(1, j)=1 for any 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 8.  

In general, any shortest path to square
(i, j) will be reached either from square (i, j − 1) or from square (i − 1, j)
square. Hence, we have the following recurrence


P(i, j) = P(i, j − 1) + P(i − 1, j) for 1 < i, j ≤ 8,
P(i, 1) = P(1, j)=1 for 1 ≤ i, j ≤ 8.
